## Libraries vs Frameworks

Libraries are most of the time a collection of helper functions, helpers in general to help you accelerate your coding.

Framework will give you a structured way to decompose a problem, with opinions that are fixed.

- React => Library
- jQuery => Library
- Next.js => Framework
- Rails => Framework (Batteries included)

## MVC

Model => Representation of a real process (Author, Post)
View => Templates to show / interact with the model
Controller => Methods/Functions to interact with the model (rules)
